  <li>
    <p><strong>If my concern still isn’t addressed, how do I escalate further?</strong></p>

    <p>After <strong>48 hours</strong> of your first ticket (and after raising a follow-up ticket), you can escalate the matter via email to the <strong>Internship Sponsor</strong>, with CC to <strong>Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar</strong>, and the following recipients in CC:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Your department <strong>HOD</strong></li>
      <li>The <strong>DLED Team</strong> at <strong>dled@iitrpr.ac.in</strong></li>
    </ul>

      <li><strong>Reference numbers</strong> and <strong>dates</strong> of the two Zoho Desk tickets</li>

  </li>

    <p><strong>I received a termination email due to overlapping academic commitments, but my exams are over now. Can I rejoin the current internship batch?</strong></p>

    <p>No. The internship is a <strong>full-time commitment</strong>, and any <strong>academic overlap</strong>, even if temporary, disqualifies a participant from continuing.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Can I appeal my termination if I have valid reasons for missing assignments or sessions?</strong></p>

    <p>The internship policy allows <strong>no leniency</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you have already received an official termination notice due to <strong>lack of attendance</strong>, <strong>late submissions</strong>, or <strong>academic overlap</strong>, your internship <strong>cannot be reinstated</strong>.</p>

    <p>These rules are strict to maintain <strong>fairness</strong> and <strong>program quality</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I plan to rejoin the internship later. Will it be the same program?</strong></p>

    <p>If you wish to participate again, you must <strong>reapply</strong> and go through the <strong>selection process</strong> for the next batch.</p>

    <p>Please note that <strong>future internships may not be funded</strong> by any organization or <strong>IIT Ropar</strong>.</p>
